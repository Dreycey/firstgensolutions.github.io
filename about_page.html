  <p class="w3-opacity"> 
	FirstGen offers a stem-cell-based platform to test for fetal safety in medications taken by expecting mothers. 
	This increases revenue by expanding the number of potential customers, preventing tragic birth defects, 
	and prevents profit-loss by rapidly testing drugs, removing the need for cumbersome and unreliable animal testing.

   <p class="w3-opacity">
   

	Prescreening drugs for safety during pregnancy is currently expensive, slow and
	inaccurate since current methods rely on animal models as a proxy to report on
	human health. Furthermore, ethical and serious health concerns restrict the
	testing of new and existing commercial products on women who are currently or
	plan to become pregnant. As a result, 70% of women who are prescribed medication
	in the United States are forced to make difficult family and health decisions
	for themselves and/or their baby. FirstGen Solutions aims to resolve this issue
	with a service to prescreen commercial products using organoids that mimic
	crucial stages of human embryological development. Ultimately, our analysis
	pipeline is fast (high-throughput and potential for automation), accurate (human 
	stem cells based models) and cheaper than the current standard.

  </div>
  
  <p> <b>How will your startup generate revenue? Describe your business model.</b> </p>
  <p class="w3-opacity">
	The company will generate revenue by requiring a fee for pre-screening drugs of
	interest sent by the pharmaceutical industry. Our pre-screening service could
	potentially save the companies time and money by detecting hazards before using
	animal models (or completely removing the need for animal models to be used).
	Additionally, for products that fail the screening process, consulting services
	can be provided to detect the source of error. In turn, companies gain crucial
	information concerning the biological impact of their products which will
	advance future research and design efforts.  
  </p>


  <p> <b>What is new, unique or different about your technology or business idea?</b> </p>
  <p class="w3-opacity">
	Most companies use organoid models to test the efficacy of personalized
	treatment options in diseases that affect specific organs of adult humans.
	However, none of these options are viable methods to screen complex
	morphogenetic events that occur during embryonic development. Our technology
	uses advanced cell culture methods that recapitulate crucial embryonic events,
	such as the folding of the neural plate to form a neural tube. This is crucial,
	as disruption of the neural tube represents one of the most common birth defects
	worldwide. The application of our technology will directly address the unmet
	need in the market to ensure the safety of continuing medication before and
	during pregnancy.

  <p> <b>What inspired or motivated you to pursue this business idea?</b> </p>
  <p class="w3-opacity">

	  This technology was developed in the Warmflash lab by George Britton
	  (founder), yet the primary push came with the entrepreneurial experience
	  offered by the IdeaLaunch program through Rice University. Through this
	  program, the founders created a team and tested their ideas on surrounding
	  participants as well as other contact. In addition to a potential market for
	  the product, the very process of entrepreneurship was enjoyed by the entire
	  team. 
	
	What started as a project motivated by scientific curiosities had expanded to
	better understand the social implications of his scientific endeavors.  In this
	pursuit, he, together with Dreycey and Kareem, entered Rice's Idealaunch program
	as an introduction to the entrepreneurial space.  Through this short program,
	the founders tested and refined their ideas based on feedback from their fellow
	participants and instructors. In addition to discovering a potential market for
	the technology, the very process of entrepreneurship has been a rewarding
	experience for each member of the team .
